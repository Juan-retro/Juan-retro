# About me

- 🔭 I'm finishing my Master's in Bioinformatics at UEM while learning more about R, Python, Bash, Git, and other tools useful for bioinformatics.
  
- 🌱 Right now, I'm mastering R and focusing on data analysis. In the future, I aim to become proficient in Python and explore Machine Learning as it relates to bioinformatics.
  
- 🤝 I'd love to collaborate with a lab or company as a bioinformatician, particularly in biology and healthcare-related fields.
  
- 💬 Although I’m still building experience, I have a solid background in Biology and Chemistry, and I’m always happy to discuss anything in these areas.
  
- 📫 Feel free to contact me via the email provided on my GitHub profile or through LinkedIn.
  
- 👾 In my spare time, I enjoy reading, playing video games, and engaging in role-playing games (RPGs). A good mix of relaxation and creativity!
